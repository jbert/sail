DONE - fix cell offset

DONE - fix 1st frame
    - have cell walker which returns values
    - pass in helper to act on each cell to draw

DONE - find a scalar field which changes over time

DONE - add drawing of a vector field

DONE - compute vector field as a function of the scalar

- write a vec type
    - seamlessly + lazily moves from cartesian to polar

- add a sail:
    - line segment
    - calculate force on the line segment from the vector field

- add a boat:
    - mass
    - centre of mass
    - fix the sail to the boat  (two points)
        - calculate the force applied to the boat
        - translational and rotational
            - 

- turn forces into velocities

- add a keel
    - suppresses (all? most?) component of 

- work out keyboard input
    - add a rudder
    - allow setting l+r
    - derive force on boat from rudder
        (needs boat speed, so maybe do that first)

- add 2d perlin noise field (0 -> 1.0)

- make it 3d and use tick as 3rd dimension
