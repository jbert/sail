- sort out x/y/radians-dir etc

- add velocity component from vector field (current)
    - decay velocity component perpendicular to direction
        (keel effect)
    - actually this depends on the current!
    - interesting function it should take into account the difference between current and boat velocity
    - and the constant of proportionality should depend on angle (cos theta?)

- put together a few different current fields
    - whirlpool
    - basic left to right
    - left-to-right with angle changing over time

- draw currents on/off
    - keyboard command

- keyboard command (and button?) to change current patterns (and show currents)

- add (optional?) docstring to cart-and-polr macro

DONE - fix cell offset

DONE - fix 1st frame
    - have cell walker which returns values
    - pass in helper to act on each cell to draw

DONE - find a scalar field which changes over time

DONE - add drawing of a vector field

DONE - compute vector field as a function of the scalar

DONE - write a vec type
    DONE - seamlessly + lazily moves from cartesian to polar

    DONE - find a way to compare 0 and 0.0 equal for tests

- add a sail:
    - line segment
    - calculate force on the line segment from the vector field

- add a boat:
    - mass
    - centre of mass
    - fix the sail to the boat  (two points)
        - calculate the force applied to the boat
        - translational and rotational
            - 

- turn forces into velocities

- add a keel
    - suppresses (all? most?) component of 

- work out keyboard input
    - add a rudder
    - allow setting l+r
    - derive force on boat from rudder
        (needs boat speed, so maybe do that first)

- add 2d perlin noise field (0 -> 1.0)

- make it 3d and use tick as 3rd dimension
